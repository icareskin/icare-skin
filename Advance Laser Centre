Restore Your Confidence: Custom Hair Loss Solutions at I Care – Advance Laser Centre, Donnybrook, Melbourne 
Are you struggling with hair thinning, bald patches, or conditions like Alopecia Areata? At I Care – Advance Laser Centre in Donnybrook, we offer an effective, personalised approach to combat hair loss using a powerful combination of PRP Hair Boost Therapy and natural herbal treatments.

Led by Dr Sandeep, an experienced practitioner in hair growth and scalp health, our clinic specialises in customised solutions for all types of hair loss – including autoimmune conditions like Alopecia Areata, where patchy hair loss can appear suddenly and progress quickly if left untreated.

What is PRP Hair Boost Therapy?

Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy uses your body’s natural healing factors, drawn from your own blood, to stimulate dormant hair follicles, repair damaged tissue, and encourage regrowth. When paired with our targeted herbal treatments, this approach provides a safe, non-surgical solution that nourishes both scalp and hair.
